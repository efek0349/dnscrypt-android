# Changelog


## 2.0.45

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.45 | jedisct1
 - Configuration changes (to be required in versions 2.1.x):
   * `[blacklist]` has been renamed to `[blocked_names]`
   * `[ip_blacklist]` has been renamed to `[blocked_ips]`
   * `[whitelist]` has been renamed to `[allowed_names]`
   * `generate-domains-blacklist.py` has been renamed to
     `generate-domains-blocklist.py`, and the configuration files have been
     renamed as well.
 - `dnscrypt-proxy -resolve` has been completely revamped, and now requires
the configuration file to be accessible. It will send a query to an IP address
of the `dnscrypt-proxy` server by default. Sending queries to arbitrary
servers is also supported with the new `-resolve name,address` syntax.
 - Relay lists can be set to `*` for automatic relay selection. When a wildcard
is used, either for the list of servers or relays, the proxy ensures that
relays and servers are on distinct networks.
 - Lying resolvers are detected and reported.
 - New return code: `NOT_READY` for queries received before the proxy has
been initialized.
 - Server lists can't be older than a week any more, even if directory
permissions are incorrect and cache files cannot be written.
 - macOS/arm64 is now officially supported.
 - New feature: `allowed_ips`, to configure a set of IP addresses to
never block no matter what DNS name resolves to them.
 - Hard-coded IP addresses can be immediately returned for test queries
sent by operating systems in order to check for connectivity and captive
portals. Such responses can be sent even before an interface is considered
as enabled by the operating system. This can be configured in a new section
called `[captive_portals]`.
 - On Linux, OpenBSD and FreeBSD, `listen_addresses` can now include IP
addresses that haven't been assigned to an interface yet.
 - The logo has been tweaked to look fine on a dark background.
 - `generate-domains-blocklist.py`: regular expressions are now ignored in
time-based entries.
 - Minor bug fixes and logging improvements.
 - Cloaking plugin: if an entry has multiple IP addresses for a type,
all the IP addresses are now returned instead of a random one.
 - Static entries can now include DNSCrypt relays.
 - Name blocking: aliases relying on `SVCB` and `HTTPS` records can now
be blocked in addition to aliases via regular `CNAME` records.
 - EDNS-Client-Subnet information can be added to outgoing queries.
Instead of sending the actual client IP, ECS information is user
configurable, and IP addresses will be randomly chosen for every query.
 - Initial DoH queries are now checked using random names in order to
properly measure CDNs such as Tencent that ignore the padding.
 - DoH: the `max-stale` cache control directive is now present in queries.
 - Logs can now be sent to `/dev/stdout` instead of actual files.
 - User switching is now supported on macOS.
 - New download mirror (https://download.dnscrypt.net) for resolvers,
relays and parental-control.

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.42 | jedisct1
- 

##### Updated module files to 2.0.42-3 | quindecim
- Disabled properly `IPv6` queries in `post-fs-data.sh` file (no more DNS leaks this time)


## 2.0.42-2

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.42 | jedisct1
- 

##### Updated module files to 2.0.42-2 | quindecim
- Disabled every `IPv6` queries in `post-fs-data.sh` file: `INPUT`, `FORWARD` and `OUTPUT` (to enforce leaks prevention in some cases).


## 2.0.42-1

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.42 | jedisct1
- 

##### Updated module files to 2.0.42-1 | quindecim
- Added `meganerd` resolver (Non-logging, non-filtering, supports DNSSEC by MegaNerd.nl).
- Enabled `whitelist.txt` file (as placeholder, once the blacklist goes public).

- Removed `ffmuc.net` resolver and related relays.
- Removed `publicarray-au2` resolver and related relays.
- Moved all the example documents into `dnscrypt-proxy/example-docs` folder (the remaining example documents must be deleted manually).


## 2.0.42

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.42 | jedisct1
- The current versions of the `dnsdist` load balancer (presumably used
by quad9, cleanbrowsing, qualityology, freetsa.org, ffmuc.net,
opennic-bongobow, sth-dnscrypt-se, ams-dnscrypt-nl and more)
is preventing queries over 1500 bytes from being received over UDP.
Temporary workarounds have been introduced to improve reliability
with these resolvers for regular DNSCrypt. Unfortunately, anonymized
DNS cannot be reliable until the issue is fixed server-side. `dnsdist`
authors are aware of it and are working on a fix.
- New option in the `[anonymized_dns]` section: `skip_incompatible`,
to ignore resolvers incompatible with Anonymized DNS instead of
using them without a relay.
- The server latency benchmark is faster while being able to perform
more retries if necessary.
- Continuous integration has been moved to GitHub Actions.

##### Updated module files to 2.0.42 | quindecim
- Enabled `skip_incompatible` option to ignore servers incompatible with anonymization


## 2.0.41

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.41 | jedisct1
- Precompiled binaries for armv5, armv6 and armv7 are available.
The default arm builds were not compatible with older CPUs when
compiled with Go 1.14. mips64 binaries are explicitly compiled with
softfloat to improve compatibility.
- Quad9 seems to be only blocking fragmented queries over UDP for
some networks. They have been removed from the default list of broken
resolvers; runtime detection of support for fragments should now do
the job.
- Runtime detection of support for fragments was actually enabled.

##### Updated module files to 2.0.41 | quindecim
- 


## 2.0.40

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.40 | jedisct1
- Servers blocking fragmented queries are now automatically detected.
- The server name is now only present in query logs when an actual upstream servers was required to resolve a query.
- TLS client authentication has been added for DoH.
- The Firefox plugin is now skipped for connections coming from the local DoH server.
- DoH RTT computation is now more accurate, especially when CDNs are in the middle.
- The forwarding plugin is now more reliable, and handles retries over TCP.

##### Updated module files to 2.0.40 | quindecim
- 


## 2.0.39-2

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.39 | jedisct1
- 

##### Updated module files to 2.0.39-2 | quindecim
- Removed `blacklist.txt` file *(too many false positives, will be added back in the future, when it reaches a more stable level)*.


## 2.0.39-1

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.39 | jedisct1
- 

##### Updated module files to 2.0.39-1 | quindecim
- Implemented automatic redirection. No more third-party apps are required to start it.
- Introduced substrings and wildcards into `blacklist.txt` file and updated to `2020-03-19`.
- Removed `ibksturm` resolver and related relays.
- Removed `dnswarden-dc1`, `dnswarden-dc2`, `dnswarden-dc3`, resolvers and related relays.


## 2.0.39

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.39 | jedisct1
- The Firefox Local DoH service didn't properly work in version 2.0.38; 
this has been fixed. Thanks to Simon Brand for the report!

##### Updated module files to 2.0.39 | quindecim
- Added `dnswarden-dc3` (DnsCrypt protocol . Non-logging, supports DNSSEC. By https://dnswarden.com).
- Updated `Magisk Module Installer template`. It require `Magisk 19+` from now on.
- Fixed an issue where `dnscrypt-proxy` doesn't detect the config file.
- Updated `blacklist.txt` to `2020-01-30`.


## 2.0.38

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.38 | jedisct1
- Entries from lists (forwarding, blacklists, whitelists) now support
inline comments.
- Reliability improvement: queries over UDP are retried after a timeout
instead of solely relying on the client.
- Reliability improvement: during temporary network outages, cached records
are now served even if they are stale.
- Bug fix: SOCKS proxies and DNS relays can be combined.
- New feature: multiple fallback resolvers are now supported (see the
new `fallback_resolvers` option. Note that `fallback_resolver` is
still supported for backward compatibility).
- Windows: the service can be installed with a configuration file
stored separately from the application.
- Security (affecting DoH): precompiled binaries of `dnscrypt-proxy 2.0.37` are
built using `Go 1.13.7` that fixes a TLS certificate parsing issue present in
previous versions of the compiler.

##### Updated module files to 2.0.38 | quindecim
- Added `dnswarden-dc3` (DnsCrypt protocol . Non-logging, supports DNSSEC. By https://dnswarden.com).
- Updated `Magisk Module Installer template`. It require `Magisk 19+` from now on.
- Fixed an issue where `dnscrypt-proxy` doesn't detect the config file.
- Updated `blacklist.txt` to `2020-01-30`.


## 2.0.36

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.36 | jedisct1
- New option: `block_undelegated`. When enabled, `dnscrypt-proxy` will
directly respond to queries for locally-served zones (https://sk.tl/2QqB971U)
and nonexistent zones that should have been kept local, but are frequently
leaked. This reduces latency and improves privacy.
- Conformance: the `DO` bit is now set in synthetic responses if it was
set in a question, and the `AD` bit is cleared.
- The `miegkg/dns` module was updated to version 1.1.26, that fixes a
security issue affecting non-encrypted/non-authenticated DNS traffic. In
`dnscrypt-proxy`, this only affects the forwarding feature.

##### Updated module files to 2.0.36 | quindecim
- Added `dnscrypt.one` resolver (DNSSEC / no logs / uncensored, Germany (Nuremberg), https://dnscrypt.one/)
- Optimized relays based on geolocation
- Updated `blacklist.txt` to `2019-12-22`


## 2.0.35

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.35 | jedisct1
- New option: `block_unqualified` to block `A`/`AAAA` queries with
unqualified host names. These will very rarely get an answer from upstream
resolvers, but can leak private information to these, as well as to root
servers.
- When a `CNAME` pointer is blocked, the original query name is now logged
along with the pointer. This makes it easier to know what the original
query name, so it can be whitelisted, or what the pointer was, so it
can be removed from the blacklist.

##### Updated module files to 2.0.35 | quindecim
- Added `scaleway-ams` resolver (DNSSEC/Non-logged/Uncensored in Amsterdam- ARM server donated by Scaleway.com)
Maintained by Frank Denis- https://fr.dnscrypt.info)

(An open DNSCrypt resolver operated by Freifunk Munich with nodes in DE.
https://ffmuc.net/)
- Fixed backup an existing `.toml` file before proceed with the installation
- Optimized relays based on geolocation
- Updated `blacklist.txt` to `2019-12-09`


## 2.0.34

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.34 | jedisct1
- Blacklisted names are now also blocked if they appear in `CNAME`
pointers.
- `dnscrypt-proxy` can now act as a local DoH *server*. Firefox can
be configured to use it, so that ESNI can be enabled without bypassing
your DNS proxy.

##### Updated module files to 2.0.34 | quindecim
- Added `ibksturm`- dnscrypt-server (nginx- encrypted-dns- unbound backend), DNSSEC / Non-Logged / Uncensored, OpenNIC and Root DNS-Zone- Hosted in Switzerland by ibksturm, aka Andreas Ziegler)
- Enabled `blacklist.txt` file to prevent `CNAME Cloaking` tracking feature
- Optimized relays based on geolocation
- Removed `charis` and `suami` resolvers and their relays


## 2.0.33

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.33 | jedisct1
- Fixes an issue that caused some valid queries to return `PARSE_ERROR`.
- On certificate errors, the server name is now logged instead of the
provider name, which is generally more useful.
- IP addresses for DoH servers that require DNS lookups are now cached
for at least 12 hours.
- `ignore_system_dns` is now set to `true` by default.
- A workaround for a bug in Cisco servers has been implemented.
- A corrupted or incomplete resolvers list is now ignored, keeping the
last good known cached list until the next update. In addition, logging was
improved and unit tests were also added. Awesome contribution from William
Elwood, thanks!
- On Windows, the network probe immediately returned instead of blocking
if `netprobe_timeout` was set to `-1`. This has been fixed.
- Expired cached IP addresses now have a grace period, to avoid breaking the
service if they temporarily can't be refreshed.
- On Windows, the service now returns immediately, solving a long-standing
issue when initialization took more than 30 seconds ("The service did not
respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion"). Fantastic
work by Alison Winters, thanks!
- The `SERVER_ERROR` error code has been split into two new error codes:
`NETWORK_ERROR` (self-explanatory) and `SERVFAIL` (a response was returned,
but it includes a `SERVFAIL` error code).
- Responses are now always compressed.

##### Updated module files to 2.0.33 | quindecim
- Added `v.dnscrypt.uk-ipv4`- DNSCrypt v2, no logs, uncensored, DNSSEC. Hosted in London UK on Vultr- https://www.dnscrypt.uk
- Optimized relays based on geolocation and set to use other providers different from the main one 


## 2.0.31

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.31 | jedisct1
- This version fixes a startup issue introduced in version 2.0.29, on systems for which the service cannot be automatically installed (such as OpenBSD and FreeBSD). Reported by @5ch17 and Vinícius Zavam, and fixed by Will Elwood, thanks!
- This version fixes two regressions introduced in version 2.0.29: DoH server couldn't be reached over IPv6 any more, and the proxy couldn't be interrupted while servers were being benchmarked.

##### Updated module files to 2.0.31 | quindecim
- Changed the way to backup an existing .toml file. The old configuration is now backed up with `year-month-day-hour-minute.bak` suffix (thanks to @lindroidux)

## 2.0.28

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.28 | jedisct1
- Invalid server entries are now skipped instead of preventing a source from being used. Thanks to Alison Winters for the contribution!
- Truncated responses are immediately retried over TCP instead of waiting for the client to retry. This reduces the latency for large responses.
- Responses sent to the local network are assumed to support at least 1252 bytes packets, and use optional information from EDNS up to 4096 bytes. This also reduces latency.
- Logging improvements: servers are not logged for cached, synthetic and cloaked responses. And the forwarder is logged instead of the regular server for forwarded responses.


## 2.0.27

##### Updated binary files to 2.0.27 | jedisct1
- The X25519 implementation was changed from using the Go standard implementation to using Cloudflare's CIRCL library. Unfortunately, CIRCL appears to be broken on big-endian systems. That change has been reverted.
